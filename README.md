# Oxford-102-Flower-Classification-using-Transfer-Learning-EfficientNetB0-
This project implements an end-to-end Image Classification pipeline using the Oxford 102 Flower Dataset, leveraging Transfer Learning (EfficientNetB0) for robust feature extraction and fine-tuning.   The trained model is deployed via a Streamlit web app for real-time image predictions.
